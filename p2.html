		<p>
		This is the first sketch I have done before in p5.js, I created this project using p5. I implimented simple coding techniques to created my ideal visual look.<br>
    <p></p>
    I have basic drawing fuctions like ellipse,rect,and triangles by combining example 1.1.2 and 1.1.4. The most challenging part is combining two codes together and figuring out where to place them without cover the code underneath.I don't have much experience with coding yet but I played around with the code to see how it would change. I edited it to make it more cartoony by simply removing the no stroke. I also change the fill to make the triangle light red and the circle purple.   <br>
    <p></p>
    I really enjoyed this excercise because eventhough I do not have a whole lot of knowledge with coding, geting to play around with the code and figuring out how the visual look change brings a lot of enjoyment to me.

         <h5>This Game is NOT Working! 2</h5>
		<p>
		     In this sketch I played with different kinds of built-in function, array fuctions, images, and gif functions. I initially started my project by creating a 2d shooting game, I used "let" function to build an array of things like bullets, enemies, score systems, and many more.  <br>
        </p> </p> 
         I then included preload images and gifs in the background by using functions like boolean logic, loadImage(), image(), tint(), and preload. <br>
        </p> </p> 
        The most challenging part of this project was making the game work, but I spent way too much time on it that I lost track of what I actually need to work on for this excercise. I then change my focus on figuring out how to put images and text for this excercise. Also, I just try to make the most out of what I currently know and not overthink the porject too much.  <br>
      </p> </p>
        This is the excercise where I had the most fun. Eventhough I tried to create a game that does not work properly, I learned a lot of things along the way and I get to use my creativity to make something out of a broken game.

         <h5> Drawing Software 1</h5>
		<p>
		In this first project I created a drawing program where I can select different drawing tools from key 1 to key 7. Each brush have unique looks in which I can use to create interesting visuals. I used Global variable like current Key,bgc,gkcount. I also use drawing functions and named it by puting my initials. <br>    
    <p></p>
    This project was really fun to make because I was eble to create a flexible drawing program where I can choose between drawing brushes and tools. It's not as good as Photoshop yet, but with a little bit more of exploring and editing I can definetly make this software better. <br>
